Full-stack developer with an interest in financial and healthcare technology, who is reverse engineering web applications. I've supported the non-tech industry's use of digital technology and led growth at a bank and hospital in my capacity as lead engineer. More than 6 years of varied experience in software engineering, with emphasis on frontend development, backend development, software architecture design, and security engineering.

Love to share my knowledge and experience to benefit open sources and tech communities. Interested in devising a better problem-solving system for challenging tasks, and learning the latest technologies and tools.
